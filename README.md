Developed a comprehensive bookstore application leveraging the MERN stack.  
Utilized MongoDB for efficient data storage , Express.js for server-side routing, React.js for dynamic client-side interactions, and Node.js for backend logic.
Allowing new users to create accounts.
Free books are fetched from the database and displayed to all users without restrictions. The front end retrieves the book data from the API and renders it in a public section of the application.
Paid books are accessible only to loggedin users. The application uses protected routes to ensure that only logged-in users can access the paid book content.
